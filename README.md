## AI Flashcard Generator
I made this project to easily fill out flashcards to make studying more efficient.

## Tech Used
Used Python and OpenAI API to generate a certain number of flashcards based on a .txt file. Also implemented a GUI using Tkinter to make input of file easy. Flashcards are placed into a csv file for easy manipulation.
